Project Description:
	Transcendent Memory (or tmem in short) is memory optimization technique
for the virtualized environment. The idea is to collect the underutilized memory
of the guests and the unassigned memory of the host and places it into a a
central pool. Indirect access to the pool is then provided to the guests to
relieve their memory pressures. This technique also aims to reduce the number of
disk accesses by storing the page cache pages into a special tmem pool called as
'Cleancache' and similarly the swap pages can be stored in a tmem pool called as
'Frontswap'.
	We implement this technique in the KVM Hypervisor.

To enable Transcendent memory support on the kvm host add the boot parameter:
"kvmtmem"

And to enable Transcendent memory in the kvm guests add the boot parameter:
"tmem"

To disable selfballooning add the boot parameter:
"noselfballooning"

Run update-grub and reboot.


Note: If you want to use zcache and kvm-tmem both at the host, add the both the parameters("zcache kvmtmem").
